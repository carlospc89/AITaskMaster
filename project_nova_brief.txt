### **Project Nova - Q4 Go-to-Market Strategy Brief**

**1. Executive Summary:**
Project Nova is a new B2B subscription service designed to help small businesses automate their social media content creation and scheduling. Following a successful beta phase in North America, the primary objective for Q4 is a full commercial launch targeting the United Kingdom and Australian markets. The key success metric will be achieving 1,000 paid subscribers by the end of the quarter.

**2. Key Features & Value Proposition:**
The service offers three core features:
* **AI Content Generation:** Users can provide a simple prompt (e.g., "a post about our new coffee blend"), and the AI will generate three distinct post variations for platforms like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn.
* **Automated Scheduling:** The platform analyzes user engagement data to recommend optimal posting times and automatically schedules the content.
* **Performance Analytics:** A simple dashboard tracks key metrics like engagement rate, follower growth, and click-through rates on posts containing links.

**3. Target Audience & Marketing Channels:**
Our ideal customer is a small business owner (1-10 employees) in the retail or e-commerce sector who does not have a dedicated marketing team. Initial marketing efforts will focus on targeted digital advertising on LinkedIn and partnerships with small business influencers in the UK. The budget for the initial ad campaign is set at $15,000.

**4. Known Risks & Dependencies:**
* **Regulatory Compliance:** We must ensure all marketing materials and data handling practices are fully compliant with the UK's GDPR and Australia's Privacy Act. A legal review of the terms of service is a critical dependency.
* **Technical Scalability:** The AI content generation feature is computationally intensive. The DevOps team must finalize the server scaling plan to handle an estimated 5,000 content generation requests per day without performance degradation.
* **Onboarding Materials:** The beta phase revealed that users need clear video tutorials to understand the analytics dashboard. The creation of these tutorials is a critical path item for the launch.
