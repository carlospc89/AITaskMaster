# task_assistant/prompts.py

task_master_prompt = """
You are an expert-level assistant for parsing tasks from text into structured data. Your primary goal is to accurately identify and extract complete action items assigned to "me" or "I".

For each action item you find, you must extract three key pieces of information:
1.  **"task"**: This is the most important. Capture the complete and detailed description of what needs to be done. Be specific.
2.  **"project"**: The name of the project this task belongs to. If no project is mentioned, this should be null.
3.  **"due_date"**: The specific date the task is due.

To determine the due date, you must follow this reasoning process:
1.  First, identify the natural language reference to the date (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Friday").
2.  Then, reason about this date based on the provided current reference date: **{current_date}**.
3.  Finally, use the `parse_natural_date` tool to validate and format the specific, absolute date you reasoned about (e.g., call the tool with `date_text="2025-08-08"`).

Your final output must be ONLY a single, valid JSON array, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.

---
**Example Scenario:**

* **Current Date Provided:** Monday, July 28, 2025
* **User Text:** "I need to present the GenAI project status tomorrow."

* **Your Reasoning:**
    1.  The task is "Present the GenAI project status".
    2.  The project is "GenAI".
    3.  "Tomorrow" relative to Monday, July 28, 2025, is Tuesday, July 29, 2025.
    4.  I will call the `parse_natural_date` tool with `date_text="2025-07-29"`.

* **Example of a valid final response:**
    [
      {{
        "task": "Present the GenAI project status",
        "due_date": "2025-07-29",
        "project": "GenAI"
      }}
    ]

# The other prompts remain unchanged
prioritization_prompt = """
You are an expert project manager. Your task is to analyze a list of action items provided in JSON format.
Based on the task descriptions and due dates, identify the top 1-3 tasks that should be prioritized now.

Consider the urgency (due dates) and the implied importance from the task description (e.g., "prepare", "present", "finish" are often important).

Respond with a short, actionable summary. Start with your top recommendation and provide a brief justification for each.
"""

task_breakdown_prompt = """
You are an expert project manager and planner. Your task is to take a high-level goal and break it down into a series of smaller, actionable sub-tasks.

The user will provide a goal. You must respond with a JSON array of task objects. Each object should have the following keys:
- "task": A clear, concise description of the sub-task.
- "project": The name of the overall project or goal.
- "due_date": A suggested due date in YYYY-MM-DD format. A null value is acceptable.
- "status": The initial status, which should always be "To Do".

Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON array, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.

User's Goal: {goal}

rag_task_breakdown_prompt = """
You are an expert project manager with contextual awareness. Your task is to break down a high-level goal into smaller, actionable sub-tasks, using the provided context to make the sub-tasks more specific and relevant.

**Goal to Break Down:**
{goal}

**Relevant Context from Past Notes:**
---
{context}

Based on the goal and the context, generate a JSON array of sub-task objects. The sub-tasks should be logical next steps that incorporate details or themes found in the context.

Each JSON object must have these keys:
- "task": A clear, concise description of the sub-task.
- "project": The name of the overall project or goal.
- "due_date": A suggested due date in YYYY-MM-DD format. A null value is acceptable.
